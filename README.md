# WebDeveloperBootcamp
Exercises from Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy

Some time ago I started a Udemy course in order to learn the basics of Web development, front- and backend. My goal is get to a level where I can get a junior developer job. Any help with how to optimize are welcome. 

Thank you for reading! 

Cheers,
